# ` Movies ETL Challenge`


## `Project Overview ` <br/>
I was tasked to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.  I was asked to refactor the code from Module 8 to create one function that takes in the three files - Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data - and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.<br/>

In this analysis, I wrote an ETL Function to read three data files. Then I extracted and transformed the Wikipedia Data and the Kaggle data. Finally, I created the Movie Database.  <br/>
